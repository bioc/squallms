\usage{
extractChromMetrics(
  peak_data,
  recalc_betas = FALSE,
  ms1_data = NULL,
  rt_window_width = NULL,
  ppm_window_width = NULL,
  verbosity = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_data}{Flat-form XC-MS data with columns for the bounding box of
a chromatographic peak (mzmin, mzmax, rtmin, rtmax) as grouped by a feature 
ID. Must be provided WITHOUT retention time correction for proper matching
to the values in the raw data.}

\item{recalc_betas}{Scalar boolean controlling whether existing beta values
(as calculated in the XCMS object when peakpicked with \code{CentWaveParam(verboseBetaColumns=TRUE))}
should be used as-is (the default) or recalculated. See 
\url{https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/pull/685} for differences in these 
implementations.}

\item{ms1_data}{Optional data.table object produced by RaMS containing MS1
data with columns for filename, rt, mz, and int. If not provided, the files
are detected from the filepath column in peak_data.}

\item{rt_window_width}{The width of the retention time window that should
be used for PCA construction, in minutes.}

\item{ppm_window_width}{The width of the m/z window that should be used for
PCA construction, in parts per million.}

\item{verbosity}{Scalar value between zero and two determining how much 
diagnostic information is produced. Zero should return nothing, one should
return text-based progress markers, and 2 will return diagnostic plots.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing one row for each feature in peak_data, with
columns containing the median peak shape value (med_cor), the median SNR
value (med_snr), and coordinates of the feature in
the first 5 principal components space.
}
\description{
This function takes flat-form XC-MS data (i.e. the format produced by
\code{\link{makeXcmsObjectFlat}}) and calculates metrics of peak shape and
similarity for downstream processing (e.g. by \code{\link{updateXcmsObjFeats}}).
The core metrics are those described in \url{https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-023-05533-4},
corresponding to peak shape (correlation coefficient between the raw data
and an idealized bell curve, beta_cor) and within-peak signal-to-noise (
maximum intensity divided by the standard deviation of the residuals after
the best-fitting bell is subtracted from the raw data). Additionally,
the function interpolates the raw data to fixed retention time intervals
and performs a principal components analysis (PCA) across a file-by-RT matrix
which typically extracts good-looking peaks in the first component (PC1).
These functions are calculated on the raw MS data as obtained via 
\pkg{RaMS}, so either the filepaths must be included in the peak_data object
or supplied as ms1_data.
