Description: squallms is a Bioconductor R package that implements a 
  "semi-labeled" approach to untargeted mass spectrometry data. It pulls in raw 
  data from mass-spec files to calculate several metrics that are then used to 
  label MS features in bulk as high or low quality that are then passed to a 
  simple logistic model that produces a fully-labeled dataset suitable for 
  downstream analysis.
