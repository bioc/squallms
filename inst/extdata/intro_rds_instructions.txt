Three files are provided with the squallms package, all generated from the
introductory vignette (intro_to_squallms.Rmd).

The first object, intro_xcms_filled.rds, is an XCMS object saved for local unit
tests to avoid reconstructing it every time.

The second object, intro_manual_labels.rds, is the result of using 
labelFeatsManual interactively to assign quality scores to a small selection of
features for use in the vignettes.

The third object, intro_lasso_labels.rds, is the result of using 
labelFeatsLasso interactively to assign quality scores to a small selection of
features for use in the vignettes.
